## Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/stow-squid.git

cargo install --path .

# Add config to ~/.config/stow-squid/stow-squid.toml
mkdir -p ~/.config/stow-squid/ && cp example-config.toml ~/.config/stow-squid/stow-squid.toml
```

## Verbs
For all verbs, the name is of a specific dotfile and is optional. Including a name will only run the verb on that dotfile. Without a name, it will run the verb on all the dots in the config.

### Save
This is to update your dotfiles (that are scattered around your machine) to your git repo 
```
stow-squid save <name>
```

### Deploy
This is to place all your dotfiles from your git repo to all the various places they might go
```
stow-squid deploy <name>
```

### List
```
stow-squid list
```
